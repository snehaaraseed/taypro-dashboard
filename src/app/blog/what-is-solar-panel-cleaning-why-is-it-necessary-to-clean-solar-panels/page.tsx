            dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: `<p>Solar panel installations have doubled from 12.8 GW in 2023 to 24.5 GW in 2024. This reflects the acceleration of solar power in India.&nbsp;</p><p>Solar panel cleaning can increase the power generation by 15% – 30% annually. However, solar panel cleaning using the best methods is important to achieve higher efficiency of the solar plants.&nbsp;</p><p>Eliminating dust and debris from the solar panels enhances their productivity. At the commercial sites, the efficiency of the solar panels can increase by 50% – 60%.</p><p>This article gives a detailed purview regarding solar panel cleaning and the best methods used for cleaning solar panels.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What Is Solar Panel Cleaning?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Solar Panel Cleaning is a technique of removing the accumulated dust and grime from the surface of the solar panels. The soiling on the solar panels has been said to reduce the efficiency by 3% – 4% daily. This further resulted in millions of losses.</p><p>This hampers the absorption of sunlight, reducing the overall power generation of the solar plants. It may also affect the longevity of the solar panels.&nbsp;</p><p>So, timely cleaning and maintenance of solar panels are necessary to enhance the power generation through them and maximise their lifespan.&nbsp;</p><p>Depending on the location and environmental factors of the solar plant site, it is pivotal to schedule regular cleaning of the solar panels.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why Is It Necessary To Clean Solar Panels?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Regular <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://taypro.in/solar-panel-cleaning-system">solar panel cleaning</a> is required for uninterrupted power generation and to prevent any losses. Clean solar panels ensure seamless light absorption and optimal energy production.</p><p>The buildup of environmental debris and dust reduces the energy absorption by 25%, decreasing their efficiency. The persistent accumulation of dirt over the surface of the panels can also damage them if not duly maintained.&nbsp;</p><p>The sunlight absorption decreases gradually depending on the amount of dirt stuck up on the panels. These lead to spotting and abrasion, further causing minor major cracks.&nbsp;</p><p>The damage will not only diminish energy production but also cost huge repairs or replacement of solar panels.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, investment in solar panel cleaning is cost-effective. It also prevents financial and inconsistent power generation. Though the installation of solar plants might be costlier, properly maintained solar panels generate attractive returns on investment.&nbsp;</p><p>The environmental factors also impact the functioning of the solar panels. Solar plants in dusty areas or arid zones are more prone to excessive dust. In such cases, daily and professional cleaning is needed to rinse off the stubborn dirt.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Methods Of Solar Panel Cleaning</strong></p><p>There are various methods of solar panel cleaning ranging from conventional techniques to advanced automated robotic cleaning systems. The solar panel cleaning method can be either water-based or waterless, depending on factors like cost, size of the solar plant, residential or commercial, location, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>Solar panels are primarily classified into two types as mentioned below.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Manual Solar Panel Cleaning Methods</strong></p><p>Manual Solar Panel Cleaning is a traditional and commonly used method of solar panel cleaning. The various methods of manual solar cleaning are as mentioned:</p><p><strong>Dry Cleaning With Brush</strong> – Cleaning with a brush is the preferred method in dry areas with less water. Soft-bristled brush or a microfibre cloth is used for cleaning off the dust from the panels. It is effective for less debris and saves water but ineffective for sticky dust.&nbsp;</p><p>However, there are certain challenges in this method such as:</p><ul><li><p>Abrasion by sponges or brushes.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Labour-intensive and time-consuming method.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Required persistent monitoring.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Not suitable for stubborn dirt and large-scale installations.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><strong>Water-based Cleaning</strong> – In this method, mild detergent, water, soft brushes and non-abrasive sponges are used for cleaning the panels. Effective for small installations, it utilises a significant amount of water and manual effort.&nbsp;</p><p>Challenges in the water-based manual solar panel cleaning method:</p><ul><li><p>High-pressure water may result in tears, scratches, and cracks on the panels.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Water ingression can cause hazard or permanent damage to the panels.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Wastage of a huge amount of water on a regular basis.</p></li><li><p>Untreated water may leave back mineral residues on the solar panel surface.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Completely risky method without due training and expertise.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><strong>Automated Solar Panel Cleaning Robots</strong></p><img class="blog-image" src="https://taypro.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/3-1.webp"><p>Solar cleaning robots are automated and semi-automated cleaners mounted on the surface of panels.
