India is progressively leading in solar energy production and application. There are several small-scale and utility-scale solar plants in India. In India, hundreds of housing societies have installed solar panels on the rooftop for household power utilisation. However, to sustain its efficiency, it is necessary to track the performance ratio of solar modules or solar plants. This is done through the calculation of its performance ratio.&nbsp;</p><p>Performance ratio is a pivotal metric that tracks the operational efficiency and output of the solar plant. Performance ratio helps to quantify and compare the actual energy generation of the solar panels with the nominal or theoretical energy output. It is a quantitative indicator of how the solar panels are working. This is analysed in favourable conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>The performance ratio might be hampered by consistent soiling on the solar panels. This can be resolved by occasional or monthly <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://taypro.in/solar-panel-cleaning-system/solar-panel-cleaning-service/"><strong>solar module cleaning service</strong></a>. This process removes the dust and grime from the panel surface, enabling seamless sunlight absorption and energy conversion.</p><p><strong>What Is Performance Ratio or PR?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Performance Ratio is an important aspect to determine the efficiency of the solar plant. It helps to understand the need of maintenance and repairs, ensuring prolonged lifespan of the solar modules.&nbsp;</p><p>Performance ratio is generated by dividing the actual energy output with the expected or theoretical energy output. It is as mentioned below:</p><p><strong>Performance Ratio (PR) = Actual Energy Output ÷ Expected Energy Output x 100%</strong></p><p>The performance ratio is normally generated in percentage. A higher performance ratio denotes maximum efficiency of the solar modules. Whereas, a lower performance ratio denotes declined efficiency of the solar plant.&nbsp;</p><p>The average performance ratio of an expansive utility-scale solar plant ranges between 70% – 80% as estimated by . It is determined by various factors like the location, weather conditions, frequency of maintenance, etc.</p><p>The solar plant in sunny areas like Rajasthan is expected to produce more solar energy than the rainy regions of South and South West India.
