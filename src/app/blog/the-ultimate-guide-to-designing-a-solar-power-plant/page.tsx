Make sure your site offers:</p><ul><li><p>At least 5 to 6 hours of high-intensity sunlight</p></li><li><p>Avoids shades from nearby buildings or trees, etc.</p></li><li><p>Accessible from an electrical support infrastructure</p></li></ul><p>Minimal shading can even result in a significant drop in energy production, as the cells are connected in series.</p><p>You can use solar pathfinders or drone mapping tools to learn about different shading zones throughout the year.</p><p><strong>Feasibility Study</strong></p><p>Conduct a feasibility inspection of the location before installing a solar plant.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Ground Techniclaities: </strong>Asses the soil composition, scope of the land, wind pressure andd accesibility.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Financial Aspects: </strong>Calculate the capital and operational aspects, potential savings and ROI</p></li><li><p><strong>Environmental Conditions: </strong>research about the ecological impact and the local environmental rules &amp;
