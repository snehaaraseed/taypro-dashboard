Solar panel cleaning is vital for increasing the overall solar panel efficiency. Accumulated dirt can disrupt the energy conversion through the solar panels.&nbsp;</p><p>Without regular solar panel cleaning, the energy output of the solar plant can decrease by 3% – 4% per day. This daily drop in energy conversion can result in huge annual financial losses.&nbsp;</p><p>Wind and rain can remove normal dust naturally. However, sticky and stubborn dirt on the solar panels needs proper and professional solar cleaning service. Irregular solar cleaning not only reduces efficiency but also causes potential damage to the panels.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Impact of Uncleaned Solar Panels On Energy Efficiency</strong></p><p>Neglected solar panels lead to the accumulation of dust and environmental debris over a period of several months. The estimated energy output will decrease daily.&nbsp;</p><p>A 10 kW solar plant generates around 50 kWh of energy per day in 5 hours of solar radiation. This translates into 1500 kWh of energy units monthly.&nbsp;</p><p>If the solar panels are not cleaned for a month, the light absorption capacity reduces by 15% – 20% in smoggy, urban areas, as stated in the studies conducted by the IIT Bombay.&nbsp;</p><p>Then the energy output will be 1200 kWh, dropping by 20%. Considering the per kWh electricity cost as ₹ 6, the financial loss would be ₹ 1800 monthly and ₹ 21,600 annually.&nbsp;</p><p>Revenue loss and operational costs will keep increasing with the neglect or inconsistent cleaning of solar panels. It may also lead to prolonged damage or replacement, adding up to the overall cost.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How Proper Cleaning Enhances Efficiency Of The Solar Panels</strong></p><img class="blog-image" src="/uploads/2024/08/1.jpeg"><p>The increased efficiency of solar panels by cleaning uplifts their capacity for light absorption and energy conversion, giving more power output. So, below given points explain the impact of enhanced efficiency by solar panel cleaning.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Optimises Light Absorption&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Solar panels generate power by absorbing sunlight and converting it into electricity. Accumulated dust could hamper their absorption capacity. Continuous soiling forms a layer on the panel surface, obstructing the light from reaching photovoltaic cells.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, proper cleaning is imperative to remove such obstructions and boost the efficiency of the solar modules. Cleaned solar modules absorb more light and convert it into usable power.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Improves Low-Light Performance</strong></p><p>Solar panels can generate energy even in low light hours or cloudy days at a relatively minimal rate. Apart from light absorption during high sunny hours, solar cleaning also improves the low-light performance of the solar panels.</p><p>Solar panels can absorb the sunlight even during the low light hours. Rather cooler temperatures foster efficiency, increasing the energy output on a daily basis. This again underscores the need for continuous monitoring of soiling and timely cleaning.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>High Energy Output&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The seamless light absorption by thoroughly cleaned solar panels results in maximum power generation. The extent of solar power generation is based on its overall efficiency, which could be optimised by timely cleaning.&nbsp;</p><p>Solar panel cleaning enhances power generation by 15% – 30% on average, as stated in reports. Taypro’s deployment of automated <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://taypro.in/solar-panel-cleaning-system/"><strong>solar cleaning robots</strong></a> at a 50 MW solar plant in Karnataka has increased the energy output by 2250000 kWh annually.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Maximum Longevity&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Persistent dirt and bird droppings can damage the solar modules, leading to repairs and replacement. Regular solar cleaning removes accumulated dust and other environmental debris.</p><p>Scheduled cleaning cycles enable frequent inspection of the solar panels. This helps in detecting any abrasion or damage and provides quick redressal. This not only sustains the efficiency but also extends the longevity of the solar panels.</p><p><strong>Seamless Functioning</strong></p><p>Accumulated dust can increase the reflectivity of solar panels, failing to gain optimal sunlight. This further affects the energy conversion rate of the modules.&nbsp;</p><p>Dirt staining and debris result in the scattering of sunlight, which obstructs the basic function of the solar panels. Solar cleaning reduces panel reflectivity and allows more sunlight to be absorbed. This too uplifts the overall efficiency of the solar panels.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Key Aspects To Consider To Enhance Solar Panel Efficiency</strong></p><p><strong>High-Quality Panels</strong></p><p>Choosing the right and highly efficient panels is the primary aspect of solar installation. Solar panels from a reputed brand and a higher efficiency rate can convert maximum sunlight into usable energy.&nbsp;</p><p>The panel surface should be of high quality for quick absorption of sunlight without any reflection. The material of the solar modules plays a pivotal role in energy conversion. Installing advanced and quality conforming panels can generate maximum power even at a small-scale solar plant.&nbsp;</p><p>Advanced solar panels could cost more for installation, however, this would turn into more savings and add value to this long-term investment.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Proper Placement Of Solar Panels</strong></p><p>The orientation and tilt of the solar panels determine the extent of dust accumulation and absorption of the sunlight. Solar panels should be strategically tilted for optimum sun exposure.&nbsp;</p><p>Positioning of the solar panels should be as per the location’s latitude. It prevents unnecessary shading and maximises light absorption. This further results in higher power generation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Avoid Shading</strong></p><p>Surrounding trees, branches, buildings or any other structures could shade the solar panels. Shading on even a smaller portion of the panels could hamper the efficiency.&nbsp;</p><p>Shading prevents direct sunlight on the panel surface, disrupting the absorption and energy conversion process. During the installation of solar panels, they should be placed effectively avoiding the shady areas.&nbsp;</p><p>In case of frequent shading by tree branches, they should be trimmed. Otherwise, the solar panels need readjustment.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cleaning Solar Panels</strong></p><p>Solar panel cleaning is one of the pivotal factors affecting the overall efficiency of the solar panels. Regularly cleaned panels are more capable of light penetration and energy generation.&nbsp;</p><p>There are various methods of solar panel cleaning ranging from conventional to advanced techniques. Their integration depends on the scale of solar panels.
