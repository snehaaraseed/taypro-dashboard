The given points below describe how these robots work.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mounting</strong> – Solar cleaning robots are placed adjacent to the solar modules at their docking stations. Semi-automated robots need to be placed manually whereas automated solar cleaning robots automatically start the cleaning process while moving from the docking station.&nbsp;</p><p>ln automated solar cleaning robots, the cleaning cycle can be scheduled using the remote monitoring application at any convenient time.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Navigation And Movement</strong> – The solar panel cleaning robot analyses the panel surface using an in-built sensor. This helps them align their path and enables efficient movements. These robots can move from one array of solar modules to another via the bridge installed by Taypro.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cleaning Mechanism</strong> – The automated solar cleaning robots by Taypro use its dual patented cleaning mechanism. They use a pair of rotating microfibre cloths coupled with an advanced air blow technique to remove the maximum dust from the panels.&nbsp;</p><p>Utilising advanced age-detection technology, these robots detect any obstacles and edges through sensors. This prevents them from falling from the solar roof.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cloud-Based Monitoring</strong> – Solar cleaning robots are connected to the cloud and work through the remote monitoring application. This tech-driven process enables the site owner to schedule the cleaning cycle, record the stats, and set the cleaning speed.&nbsp;</p><p>The data transmitted by the robots gets safely stored in the cloud storage, which can be accessed from anywhere using the internet.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Components Of Solar Panel Cleaning Robot</strong></p><p>Following are the key components of the solar panel cleaning robot that facilitate effective cleaning of the solar models.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dual-Pass Cleaning Mechanism</strong> –&nbsp;Taypro’s solar panel cleaning robots use its own patented dual-pass cleaning mechanism. The microfibre cloth and air pressure are used to swiftly remove the dirt from the panels without causing any abrasion.&nbsp;</p><p>This advanced waterless cleaning technique prevents any mineral residue or staining. It not only saves water but also prolongs the lifespan of the solar panels through its non-abrasive and efficient cleaning method.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AI and ML-Based Weather Sensing</strong> – AI-powered and ML-based technology of these robots obtains real-time weather data from reputed global weather forecasters. The weather information is further analysed to decide the optimum time for solar cleaning.&nbsp;</p><p>The timing is finalised considering factors like humidity, wind conditions, temperature, storm conditions, and rain probability. It enables notifications regarding critical weather conditions, cancellation of scheduled cleaning cycles and a trigger before breakdown.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Independent Charging System</strong> – There are charging sources placed at the docking station adjacent to the solar arrays. The dedicated resting place on the docking station allows the batteries of the solar cleaning robots to charge fully.</p><p>The remote monitoring application displays the charging time, charging level and running time of the batteries. All the details are displayed on the monitoring portal.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Fault-Detection System</strong> –&nbsp;The advanced AI system allows early fault detection and immediate resolution. Taypro’s team of highly experienced technicians across India provides same-day breakdown resolution to facilitate seamless operation of the solar modules.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why are solar panel cleaning robots important for cleaning?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Solar panel cleaning robots are crucial for efficient cleaning and maximum lifespan of the solar modules. Compared to other methods of solar cleaning, the automated robots conduct the cleaning process effectively with AI and ML-oriented technology.&nbsp;</p><p>The automated solar cleaning robots do not require human assistance and monitoring. The remote monitoring application and cloud-based storage ensure functional efficacy and secure data, respectively.&nbsp;</p><p>With regular and thorough cleaning by automated solar panel cleaning robots, the sunlight absorption capacity of the solar modules increases. This results in maximum power output.&nbsp;</p><p>Solar panel cleaning robots not only save water, labour costs, and operational expenses but also detect any fault or damage at the very initial stage. This leads to a quick resolution and optimises the panels’ lifespan.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The below table presents the impact of integrating Taypro’s automated </strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://taypro.in/solar-panel-cleaning-system/solar-panel-cleaning-service/"><strong>solar panel cleaning service</strong></a><strong> at a 70 MW capacity solar plant at Banda, Uttar Pradesh.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>3150000 kWhPower Generation Increased7636380 LitresWater SavedRs. 1272730Labour Cost Saved4513636.35 KgTotal Carbon Reduction</p><p><strong>Benefits of solar cleaning robots</strong></p><p>Below are the advantages of using solar cleaning robots:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Enhanced Efficiency</strong> – While cleaning the accumulated dust from the panel surface, the solar panel cleaning robot uplifts the overall efficiency of the solar panels.
