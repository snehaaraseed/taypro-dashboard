              __html: `<p>Solar power is a growing energy resource in India, as its usage increased by approximately 16.6% in 2025, compared to the previous year.</p><p>As a major power source, with increasing usage, almost 25% of solar plants lose their efficiency due to technical issues and wrong practices.</p><p>Solar power plants help reduce electricity bills, provide better ROI, and are a sustainable alternative; hence, maintaining the best condition of a plant will give the best possible results.</p><p>So, let’s look at some tips to help you understand how to increase solar panel efficiency.</p><p><strong>Optimising Panel Placement</strong></p><p>The placement of your panels is the most essential aspect for increasing your solar panel’s efficiency, as it requires capturing direct sunlight to achieve optimal results.</p><p>Hence, pick a spot that receives direct sunlight throughout the day while installing the solar panels.</p><p>The angle of the panels also affects the efficiency. So, ensure that your panels do not have a fixed tilt.</p><p>For summers, a lower tilt and for winters, a steeper tilt will help you absorb more sunlight.</p><p>Even the slightest shadow can lower your solar panel’s efficiency. To avoid that, place your panels away from buildings, trees or any other object that can cast shadows for even a few hours a day.</p><p><strong>Keeping Panels Clean</strong></p><p>According to studies, unclean solar panels can reduce the plant’s efficiency by almost 20%.</p><p>Solar panels are exposed to elements like dust, dirt, pollen, bird droppings, pollution, etc., creating a thin layer that blocks direct sunlight to the panel.</p><p>To avoid this, you can avail yourself of an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://taypro.in/solar-panel-cleaning-system/automatic-solar-panel-cleaning-system/">automatic solar panel cleaning system</a>, which keeps your solar panels clean.</p><p><strong>Let’s take a look at the results generated by TAYPRO’s </strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://taypro.in/solar-panel-cleaning-system/solar-panel-cleaning-service/"><strong>solar panel cleaning service</strong></a><strong> at Soygaon, Maharashtra’s solar plant.</strong></p><p>Increase in Power Generation&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4500000 kWhWater Saved10909080 LitresLabour Cost SavedRs. 1818180Total Carbon Reduction9027272.7 Kg</p><p>&nbsp;During winters, snowfall can affect the efficiency of your solar panels, creating a thick layer of snow on your panels and blocking the direct flow of sunlight.</p><p>To prevent this, you can install the panels at a steeper angle to reduce snow buildup. Cleaning the snow yourself may cause damage to your panels, but a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://taypro.in/solar-panel-cleaning-system/">solar panel cleaning system</a> will ensure optimal maintenance of your solar panels.</p><p>A clean solar panel will absorb sunlight better, increasing the efficiency and energy production of the solar plant.</p><p><strong>Selecting the Right Technology</strong></p><img class="blog-image" src="https://taypro.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2.webp"><p>The efficiency of your solar plant depends on the type of solar panel you choose. Let’s have a look at the types of solar panels:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Monocrystalline Panels</strong></p></li></ul><p>These panels operate on maximum efficiency as compared to other panels, ranging up to 22% (or more). They are known for their longevity for lasting up to 30 years. These panels are typically expensive, but they provide the best performance in low-light conditions, too, making them the perfect choice for large-scale solar power plants.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Polycrystalline Panels</strong></p></li></ul><p>Polycrystalline is the oldest category of solar panel, operating at 16% efficiency. These panels require more rooftop space, and to achieve a specific level of results, you will require them in higher numbers. They have lower costs and can last up to 25-30 years, making them a perfect choice for residential use.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Thin-film Panels</strong></p></li></ul><p>These panels are thin, flexible sheets that can wrap around anywhere. They are light in weight, but the least efficient (7% to 13%). They are the lowest in price and have a lifespan of 10 to 15 years, making them a good option for very small-scale usage.</p><p>To enhance the efficiency of solar panels, you can also use microinverters or power optimisers.</p><p>These devices allow each panel to run independently, which means even if one of your panels is covered in shade or dirt, it won’t affect the productivity of your other panels.</p><p>All the other panels will perform at full potential to achieve the best results.</p><p><strong>Efficient Energy Conversion</strong></p><p>An inverter plays a vital role in making your solar panels efficient.</p><p>It converts the direct current (DC) electricity generated by the solar panels into alternating current (AC), which is used in our homes.&nbsp;</p><p>So, without an inverter, you won’t be able to convert the DC output into usable AC energy.</p><p>But an inefficient or outdated inverter can waste a huge amount of the generated solar energy. Hence, always choose the high conversion efficiency models that are 95 to 98% efficient and offer smart connectivity.</p><p>Here are some basic maintenance tips for your inverter:</p><ul><li><p>Keep checking the display or connected app of your inverters regularly. It might showcase a warning message or output drop in case of technical issues.</p></li><li><p>Always make sure that the inverter unit is clean and has proper ventilation.</p></li><li><p>Schedule professional inspections and servicing sessions for the inverters after regular time intervals.</p></li></ul><p>If you have a 10-year-old inverter, you can replace it with a modern one to get higher energy production outputs.</p><p><strong>Monitoring and Making Improvements</strong></p><p>Monitoring tools help you keep a real-time record of your solar panel’s efficiency.&nbsp;</p><p>Several monitoring systems offer apps or web displays showcasing the solar panel’s daily &amp; monthly energy outputs, weather adjustments, and per-panel efficiency.</p><p>This data assists you in spotting the underperforming panels, unexpected energy drops and many such issues.</p><p>If you monitor such issues with your panels, make sure to act on them instantly.&nbsp;</p><p>Ensuring the panels are clean, checking for shadows due to new obstacles, and having an inspection can help avoid any major issues with your solar panels.</p><p>Taypro’s solar cleaning system uses automated technology to monitor your panel’s performance and provide updates for technical issues, too. The smart weather sensing technology also schedules the cleaning system according to the climate conditions, so your solar panels can operate at peak efficiency.</p><p><strong>Advanced Boosting Tips</strong></p><p>A battery storage system will help your solar setup to be charged.</p><p>The batteries allow you to store the unused energy and use it during nights or on cloudy days, instead of sending the usnused power back to the usual grid.</p><p>Here are some popular battery types for your solar plant:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Lithium-ion</strong></p></li></ul><p>These batteries are compact, efficient and long-lasting for your solar panels.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Lead-acid</strong></p></li></ul><p>Compared to the other type, these batteries are much cheaper but are large in size and less efficient.</p><p>With the growing usage of solar power, manufacturers are focusing on new solar inventions, which you should keep an eye on:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Bifacial Panels</strong></p></li></ul><p>These panels have double-sided designs to capture energy better and provide higher results.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Perovskite cells</strong></p></li></ul><p>This is a type of ultra-low-cost material built to provide high efficiency for solar panels.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Anti-reflective coatings</strong></p></li></ul><p>This allows the panels to absorb more sunlight by reducing the reflectiveness of the light.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Maintaining the solar panel’s efficiency might sound a bit complicated at times, but it’s just a matter of providing the right attention and caution.</p><p>Here are a few things you should keep in mind on how to make solar panels more efficient:</p><ul><li><p>Panel placement to get the most sunlight.</p></li><li><p>Adjust the panel’s tilt to avoid shades.</p></li><li><p>Regular cleaning of the panels.</p></li><li><p>Using technology like microinverters.</p></li><li><p>Monitoring the performance and acting accordingly</p></li><li><p>Usage of batteries and new technology</p></li></ul><p>You can follow these simple steps to make the most out of your solar panels and get the desired results.&nbsp;</p>`,
