For larger plants, you can opt for a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://taypro.in/solar-panel-cleaning-system/solar-panel-cleaning-service/">solar panel cleaning service</a> to gently clean the solar panels.</p><p>Along with regular cleaning, a simple inspection of your setup is necessary. These inspections should follow:</p><ul><li><p>Inspect for cracks on the panel’s glass</p></li><li><p>Checking for rust or damage in the frame &amp; mounting structure</p></li><li><p>Look for leaves, animal nests, bird droppings &amp; debris on the panel</p></li></ul><p>Even the slightest shadow can reduce the performance of your solar panel. Here are a few things that can cast shadows on your panel:</p><ul><li><p>Overgrown trees</p></li><li><p>New nearby buildings &amp; infrastructures</p></li><li><p>Poles, wires or antennas around the plant.</p></li></ul><p>Visual inspection &amp; regular cleaning are the most effective aspects of solar panel maintenance.</p><p><strong>Electrical System Checks</strong></p><p>Loose or damaged wires are a major safety hazard, and they may lead to a loss of energy. So always inspect these things:</p><ul><li><p>Loose cable connections</p></li><li><p>Burnt or blackened wires</p></li><li><p>Chewed wires by rodents like rats</p></li><li><p>Corrosion at important touchpoints</p></li></ul><p>The inverter is the most important part of solar energy generation as it converts the absorbed sunlight from the panels into usable electricity. Inverter failure leads to the entire system shutting down; hence, check for:</p><ul><li><p>Clean &amp; dust-free surfaces</p></li><li><p>Adequate ventilation &amp; no overheating</p></li><li><p>Error messages or red lights</p></li><li><p>Unusual sounds or flickering displays</p></li></ul><p>Maintaining the BOS (Balance of system) is essential as it includes the fuses, switches, junction boxes &amp; breakers. Hence, check these things always:</p><ul><li><p>Tight cable connections</p></li><li><p>No signs of moisture or rust</p></li><li><p>Proper labelling &amp; safety signs</p></li></ul><p>To protect your solar plant from lightning or power surges, a good grounding system is required. You should necessarily check:</p><ul><li><p>Ground wiring is intact &amp; secure</p></li><li><p>No signs of rust or corrosion</p></li><li><p>Surge protectors are working properly in order</p></li></ul><p>To prevent electrical system failure, regular solar panel servicing is essential.</p><p><strong>Monitoring &amp; Performance</strong></p><img class="blog-image" src="/uploads/2024/02/PHOTO-2024-02-24-08-02-52-300x138.jpg"><p>The solar system’s dashboard or mobile app will allow you to check:</p><ul><li><p>Daily, monthly &amp; weekly energy output</p></li><li><p>Past performance comparisons</p></li><li><p>Sudden drops or irregular patterns</p></li></ul><p>Recordkeeping by maintaining a regular logbook or digital file will help you track:</p><ul><li><p>Panel cleaning dates</p></li><li><p>Inspection results</p></li><li><p>Repairs &amp; servicing visits</p></li><li><p>Performance reports</p></li></ul><p>Along with regular personal checks, it’s important to schedule a yearly professional maintenance service for:</p><ul><li><p>Testing electric safety</p></li><li><p>Finding hotspots through thermal cameras&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Check the inverter &amp; battery’s performance</p></li></ul><p>Several solar maintenance servicing packages are offered at affordable prices to help keep your system in optimal condition.</p><p><strong>Additional Checks</strong></p><p>If your solar energy setup is mounted on the rooftop, then:</p><ul><li><p>Inspect water leaks &amp; cracks</p></li><li><p>Ensure panels aren’t loosened or damaged</p></li><li><p>Look for plant or moss growth&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>The panels are mounted on metal or aluminium frames. Hence, check for:</p><ul><li><p>Rust or peeling paint</p></li><li><p>Loose bolts or fasteners</p></li><li><p>Structural cracks</p></li></ul><p>In a combiner box, multiple panel outputs are combined. So make sure:</p><ul><li><p>All electric terminals are tight</p></li><li><p>Every label is visible</p></li><li><p>No moisture or dirt inside the box</p></li></ul><p>If you are using a hybrid or off-grid setup, check these things in your solar charge controllers:</p><ul><li><p>Charging status&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Temperature indicators</p></li><li><p>Overloading or error warnings</p></li></ul><p>For the nighttime, the power is backed up by the batteries. So, maintain them by:</p><ul><li><p>Load testing</p></li><li><p>Checking for rust or white deposits on terminals</p></li><li><p>Refill water in lead-acid batteries&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Keeping them in a cool &amp; dry place</p></li></ul><p>These additional checks are an important aspect of the solar maintenance checklist.</p><p><strong>Repairs &amp; Replacements</strong></p><p>Act immediately if you see such warning signs:</p><ul><li><p>Reduced power output</p></li><li><p>Inverter error messages</p></li><li><p>Unusual noises or smells</p></li><li><p>Panel discolouration or hotspots</p></li></ul><p>Solar panels have a performance warranty of almost 20 to 25 years, and other parts such as inverters &amp; batteries have a 5 to 10 year warranty.</p><p>To protect your warranty, you should:</p><ul><li><p>Keep maintenance records</p></li><li><p>Call authorised technicians&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Follow all the recommended servicing schedule</p></li></ul><p>Many brands clearly state that to maintain the warranty eligibility, solar panel servicing must be regularly done.
