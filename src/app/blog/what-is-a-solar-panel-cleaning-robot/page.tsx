Here are the key features of the solar panel cleaning robot.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Efficient Cleaning</strong></p></li></ul><p>TAYPRO’s solar cleaning robots use microfiber cloths instead of water for cleaning purposes. The patented dual-pass technology in the robots cleans up the solar panel in two stages, simultaneously. This ensures the removal of all the dust &amp; debris from the panel, increasing the efficiency and productivity of the solar plant.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Highest Uptime Guarantee</strong></p></li></ul><p>The solar cleaning robots guarantee the highest uptime, as they require low maintenance and are reliable with almost zero downtime. This ensures that your operations are managed with no interruptions and peak performance for the solar plant.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Same Day Breakdown Resolution</strong></p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;We have a skilled team of technicians all across India, ensuring the best resolution to any robot-related issues. If the robot faces any malfunction or technical glitch, it automatically generates a web-based service ticket beforehand. This ticket can be easily tracked in real-time.</p><ul><li><p><strong>AI &amp; ML-based Advanced Cleaning</strong></p></li></ul><p>The robots are embedded with AI &amp; ML automation technology for better performance. It tracks its sensors and ensures regular data collection for updates &amp; feedback. It also assesses the surface conditions to adjust the speed/torque accordingly, and also showcases a trigger warning before breakdown.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Smart Weather Sensing</strong></p></li></ul><p>TAYPRO’s solar panel cleaning robots have a built-in weather sensor that predicts the climate based on the last 30 years of weather data. This technology analyzes the wind speed, rain probability, humidity and other climatic factors and reschedules the cleaning cycle at the most favourable time to get the desired outputs.</p><p><strong>Let’s have a brief look at the impact of TAYPRO’s </strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://taypro.in/solar-panel-cleaning-system/solar-panel-cleaning-service/"><strong>solar panel cleaning service</strong></a><strong> at the Rajkot, Gujarat plant.</strong></p><ul><li><p>Power Generation Increased:&nbsp;&nbsp;3375000 </p></li><li><p>kWhWater Saved: 2945460 Litres</p></li><li><p> Labour Cost Saved: Rs. 490910</p></li><li><p>Total Carbon Reduction: 6757363.65 Kg</p></li></ul><p><strong>Benefits of a Solar Panel Cleaning Robot</strong></p><p>With the increasing demand for solar power plants, a solar module cleaning system is becoming a necessity for plant operators.
